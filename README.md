### Hey nerds :suspect:
I enjoy coding games, apps, bots and I am constantly looking for a new challenge.<br />
My first programming language of choice is Java as that is what I have most experience with.<br />
Occasionally I code in JavaScript and C# and even try out C/C++.<br />
<br />
Currently studying as a Java/Javascript developer at EC Utbildning in Malm√∂, Sweden. :godmode:
